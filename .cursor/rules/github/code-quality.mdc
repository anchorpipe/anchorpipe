# Anchorpipe GitHub Code Quality Rules

- Enforce DCO and Conventional Commits; reject unsigned commits.
- Before proposing changes, account for required checks: lint, typecheck, build, db-health, openapi-validate, DCO, CodeQL, link-check.
- Do not suggest changes that weaken security headers/CSP, validation, CSRF/origin, or rate limits.
- Respect performance and a11y budgets; call out potential regressions and require ADR.
- Use only repository label taxonomy: `type:*`, `gate:*`, `area:*`, `priority:*`.
- Preserve monorepo structure (apps/, services/, packages/, infra/, docs/); avoid relocating without ADR.
- Provide file-by-file edits; do not invent unrelated changes; avoid whitespace-only diffs.
