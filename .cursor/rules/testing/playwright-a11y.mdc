# Anchorpipe Playwright A11y Testing Rules

- Run axe-core via `@axe-core/playwright` on all polished pages.
- Test keyboard navigation: Tab order, Enter/ESC behavior, focus management.
- Screen reader testing: Use `page.getByRole()` and semantic selectors.
- Color contrast: Verify WCAG 2.2 AA (4.5:1) for text; AAA (7:1) where targeted.
- Form accessibility: Labels, error messages, aria-live regions.
- Motion: Test with `prefers-reduced-motion` enabled.
- Block merge on critical violations (A11y-0); track medium/low with timeline.
