# anchorpipe Foundation Structure Plan

**Status**: Planning Document - Future Implementation  
**Last Updated**: 11-05-2025

> **Note**: This document outlines the planned foundation structure for anchorpipe. Actual implementation will occur when the project reaches sufficient maturity and revenue.

## Overview

As anchorpipe grows, we plan to establish a foundation or non-profit entity to hold the open-source intellectual property, separate from any commercial entity. This structure protects the open-source project while enabling commercialization.

## Why a Foundation Structure?

### Benefits

1. **IP Protection**: Foundation holds open-source IP, protecting it from commercial interests
2. **Community Governance**: Ensures community voice in project direction
3. **Legal Separation**: Clear separation between open-source and commercial activities
4. **Investor Confidence**: Clean IP ownership structure for fundraising
5. **Sustainability**: Foundation ensures project survives beyond individual ownership

### Examples

- **Linux Foundation**: Kubernetes, CNCF projects
- **Apache Software Foundation**: Many Apache projects
- **Mozilla Foundation**: Firefox and related projects
- **Eclipse Foundation**: Eclipse IDE and related tools

## Planned Structure

### Phase 1: Current Structure (Now)

- **Project Owner**: BDFL governance model
- **License**: AGPL v3
- **IP**: Held by project owner
- **Commercial Rights**: Retained by project owner

### Phase 2: Foundation Formation (12-18 months)

- **Open-Source Foundation**: Non-profit entity (501(c)(3) or equivalent)
- **IP Transfer**: Open-source code transferred to foundation
- **Governance**: Foundation board with community representation
- **Commercial License**: Foundation licenses to commercial entity

### Phase 3: Dual-Entity Structure (18-24 months)

```
anchorpipe Foundation (Non-Profit)
├── Holds: Open-source IP (AGPL v3)
├── Governance: Community + board
├── Activities: Open-source development
└── License to: Commercial entity

anchorpipe Inc. (Commercial)
├── Holds: Enterprise features IP
├── Governance: Commercial board
├── Activities: Enterprise products, support
└── Licenses from: Foundation (open-source code)
```

## Foundation Governance

### Board Structure (Planned)

- **Community Representatives**: 3-5 seats for elected community members
- **Technical Leaders**: 2-3 seats for core maintainers
- **Founder/Original Owner**: 1-2 seats
- **Independent Members**: 1-2 seats for industry experts

### Decision-Making

- **Open-Source Direction**: Foundation board decides
- **License Changes**: Requires foundation board approval
- **Major Features**: Community input through RFCs
- **Commercial Licensing**: Foundation approves commercial licenses

## IP Structure

### Foundation Holds

- ✅ All open-source code (AGPL v3)
- ✅ Project trademarks (in partnership)
- ✅ Open-source documentation
- ✅ Community contributions (via IP assignment)

### Commercial Entity Holds

- ✅ Enterprise feature code (proprietary)
- ✅ Commercial trademarks (licensed from foundation)
- ✅ Commercial documentation
- ✅ Proprietary algorithms (if any)

### License Flow

```
Contributors → Foundation (AGPL v3)
                      ↓
            Foundation → Commercial Entity (Commercial License)
                      ↓
            Foundation → Community (AGPL v3)
```

## Commercial Entity Relationship

### How They Work Together

1. **Foundation**: Holds open-source IP, ensures open-source nature
2. **Commercial Entity**: Licenses open-source code, adds enterprise features
3. **Revenue Sharing**: Commercial entity supports foundation financially
4. **Governance Separation**: Foundation independent, commercial entity separate board

### Revenue Model

- **Commercial License Fees**: Shared with foundation (percentage)
- **Foundation Support**: Commercial entity provides funding
- **Grants and Donations**: Foundation can accept donations
- **Sponsorships**: Commercial entity sponsors foundation events

## Legal Structure Options

### Option 1: 501(c)(3) Non-Profit (US)

- Tax-exempt status
- Can accept donations
- Standard structure for open-source foundations

### Option 2: Foundation Under Linux Foundation

- Leverage existing infrastructure
- Access to legal and administrative support
- Shared resources

### Option 3: International Foundation

- If founders are outside US
- Consider jurisdiction carefully
- May need multiple entities

## Implementation Requirements

### Before Foundation Formation

1. ✅ Clear IP assignment from all contributors (IP_ASSIGNMENT.md)
2. ✅ Documented governance model (GOVERNANCE.md)
3. ✅ Commercial strategy defined (COMMERCIAL_STRATEGY.md)
4. ⏳ Legal entity for commercial activities
5. ⏳ Revenue to support foundation operations

### Legal Requirements
