# Anchorpipe Gherkin Testing Rules

- Use Gherkin for acceptance criteria; link to user stories (ST-###).
- Structure: Feature → Scenario → Given/When/Then; keep scenarios focused.
- Language: Plain English; avoid technical jargon; use domain language.
- Reusability: Extract common steps; use backgrounds for shared setup.
- Examples: Use scenario outlines with examples for data-driven tests.
- Integration: Link Gherkin to Playwright tests; generate test cases from features.
