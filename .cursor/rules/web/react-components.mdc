# Anchorpipe React Component Rules

- Component structure: Props interface → Component → Export; colocate types.
- Use function components with hooks; avoid class components.
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic; keep components focused on rendering.
- Props: Use TypeScript interfaces; mark optional props with `?`; provide defaults where sensible.
- State: Prefer local state; lift up only when needed; use context sparingly.
- Performance: Memoize expensive computations; use `React.memo` for pure components; avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Accessibility: Semantic HTML; ARIA when necessary; keyboard support; focus management.
