# Anchorpipe Motion & Micro-interactions

- Purposeful animations only; communicate state/feedback or guide attention.
- Performance: GPU-friendly transforms; short durations; avoid layout thrash.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` with functional alternatives.
- Categories: feedback, transitions, loading, attention; keep subtle by default.
