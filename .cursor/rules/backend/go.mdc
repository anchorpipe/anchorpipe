# Anchorpipe Go Backend Rules

- Scalability: Design for horizontal scaling; use connection pooling; avoid global state.
- REST API: Use ServeMux or Gin/Echo; follow RESTful conventions; version endpoints.
- Error handling: Return structured errors; use error wrapping; log with context.
- Concurrency: Use goroutines judiciously; prefer channels for communication; avoid race conditions.
- Testing: Table-driven tests; use testify for assertions; benchmark critical paths.
- Code organization: Package by feature; clear interfaces; minimal dependencies.
- Performance: Profile before optimizing; use pprof; measure, don't guess.
