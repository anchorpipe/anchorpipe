# Anchorpipe Playwright E2E Testing Rules

- Thin critical paths only; avoid testing implementation details.
- Use page object model for reusable selectors and actions.
- Wait for elements with `waitFor` or `locator.waitFor()`; avoid hard-coded sleeps.
- Test user journeys, not individual components; focus on happy paths and critical error flows.
- Parallel execution where possible; isolate tests (clean state between runs).
- Screenshots/videos on failure; trace viewer for debugging.
- Respect a11y: test with screen readers; verify keyboard navigation; check ARIA attributes.
