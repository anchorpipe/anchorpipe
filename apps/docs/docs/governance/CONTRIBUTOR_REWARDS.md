# Contributor Recognition and Rewards Framework

**Status**: Framework - To Be Implemented  
**Last Updated**: 11-05-2025

> **Note**: This is a framework document outlining future contributor rewards. Specific programs will be implemented as the project matures and commercializes.

## Vision

anchorpipe believes in recognizing and rewarding contributors who help build the project. As the project grows and commercializes, we commit to sharing value with the community that makes anchorpipe possible.

## Recognition Programs (Active Now)

### 1. Public Recognition

- ✅ Credit in release notes
- ✅ Listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- ✅ Featured on project website (when launched)
- ✅ Social media recognition for significant contributions

### 2. Contributor Levels

- **Contributor**: Any contribution
- **Active Contributor**: Regular contributions over 3 months
- **Core Contributor**: Significant sustained contributions
- **Maintainer**: Commit access and release responsibilities

### 3. Contributor Benefits

- Early access to new features
- Direct input on roadmap decisions
- Priority support (when support is available)
- Contributor badges and recognition

## Future Reward Programs (Post-Commercialization)

### 1. Equity Program (Future)

**When**: After commercial entity is established and fundraising

**Who Qualifies**:

- Significant contributors (top 10-20 contributors)
- Core maintainers
- Contributors who built critical features
- Long-term active contributors

**Structure**:

- Stock options or equity grants
- Vesting over 3-4 years
- Based on contribution impact and longevity

**Example**: If you're a top 10 contributor who helped build core features, you may receive equity in the commercial entity.

### 2. Revenue Sharing (Future)

**When**: After commercial revenue is established

**Options Under Consideration**:

- **Percentage of Revenue**: Small percentage of commercial revenue to top contributors
- **Feature Bounties**: Payment for implementing specific enterprise features
- **Support Revenue Share**: Percentage of support contracts to maintainers
- **Custom Development**: Paid opportunities to build commercial features

**Structure**:

- Transparent allocation methodology
- Regular distributions
- Based on contribution impact and commercial relevance

### 3. Bounty Program (Future)

**When**: After establishing commercial revenue

**Structure**:

- Specific features or bugs with bounties
- Open to all contributors
- Clear payment terms
- Milestone-based payments

**Example**: "$5,000 bounty for implementing SSO/SAML authentication for enterprise edition"

### 4. Maintainer Compensation (Future)

**When**: After commercial revenue is established

**For**:

- Core maintainers with significant responsibilities
- Release managers
- Security maintainers
- Documentation maintainers

**Structure**:

- Monthly stipend or salary
- Based on time commitment and responsibilities
- Contract or part-time employment

## Transparency and Fairness

### Principles

- **Transparent Criteria**: Clear guidelines for who qualifies
- **Fair Evaluation**: Contribution impact measured objectively
- **No Surprises**: Contributors know what to expect
- **Community Input**: Community feedback on reward structures

### Metrics We Track

- Code contributions (lines, commits, PRs)
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes and issue resolution
- Community support (Discussions, Q&A)
- Feature impact and usage

## Legal Considerations

### Tax Implications

- Rewards may be taxable income
- We'll provide necessary tax documentation
- Consult tax professional for advice

### IP Rights

- Rewards don't change IP assignment (see IP_ASSIGNMENT.md)
- Contributors retain copyright
- Commercial use rights remain as documented

## Questions?

- **Rewards Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions (programs will be available post-commercialization)
- **Contributor Status**: Check CONTRIBUTORS.md or GitHub contributor stats
- **General**: GitHub Discussions

## Examples from Other Projects

### Successful Models

- **GitLab**: Equity for significant contributors, revenue sharing
- **MongoDB**: Contributor recognition, commercial opportunities
- **Elastic**: Contributor programs, conference sponsorships
- **Red Hat**: Maintainer compensation, contributor support

## Updates

This framework will evolve based on:

- Project success and revenue
- Community feedback
- Industry best practices
- Legal and tax considerations

Significant changes will be announced in GitHub Discussions and documented here.
