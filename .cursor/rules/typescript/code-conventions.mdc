# Anchorpipe TypeScript Code Conventions

- Use strict mode; enable all strict checks in tsconfig.
- Prefer const over let; avoid var entirely.
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) appropriately.
- Destructure objects/arrays for clarity; avoid deep nesting.
- Use enums or const objects for constants; prefer const objects for better tree-shaking.
- Import organization: external → internal → relative; group by type.
- Export explicitly; use named exports over default when possible.
- Comments: Explain why, not what; use JSDoc for public APIs.
