# ADR-0010: Product Site CTAs — OSS-first Messaging

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2025-10-21

## Context

- Avoid implying a hosted paid tier at MVP.

## Decision

- CTAs: "Get Started" (Open on GitHub / Quickstart) and "Watch 2‑min Demo".
- Reserve "Start Free Trial" for future hosted tier; gated by a separate ADR.

## Consequences

- Clear expectations; supports OSS community growth.

## Alternatives considered

- Early "trial" CTA (misleading, premature).

## Revisit criteria

- When hosted service strategy ADR is approved.

## References

- UI/UX Landing; PRD §11.
