# Anchorpipe Conventional Commits + DCO

- Use Conventional Commits:
  - `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore.
  - Common scopes: web, infra, services/ingestion, services/scoring, docs, ci.
- DCO required on every commit. Example: `git commit -s -m "feat(web): add CSP for /api routes"`.
- Use BREAKING CHANGE footer or `!` when applicable.
