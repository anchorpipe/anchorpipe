## Welcome to the anchorpipe Community 👋

anchorpipe exists to make testing better for everyone. We believe the best solutions come from diverse perspectives, respectful collaboration, and a culture where everyone feels empowered to contribute.

This Code of Conduct outlines our shared values and expectations. Whether you're filing your first issue, submitting your hundredth PR, or just asking a question—you belong here.

**Our Community Values:**

- 🤝 **Collaboration over competition** - We succeed together
- 💡 **Curiosity over criticism** - We ask questions before making assumptions
- 🌱 **Growth over perfection** - We learn from mistakes
- 🎯 **Impact over ego** - We focus on the work, not who's right
- 🌍 **Inclusion over exclusion** - We actively welcome new voices

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Commitment to Diversity & Inclusion

Beyond preventing harassment, we actively work to build a diverse and inclusive community:

### Proactive Inclusion Efforts

- **Diverse representation** in maintainer and moderator roles (as the project grows)
- **Accessibility** in our tools, docs, and communication
- **Inclusive language** in code, comments, and documentation
- **Mentorship programs** for newcomers (see [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md))
- **Financial support** for contributors who need it (see [Contributor Rewards](docs/governance/CONTRIBUTOR_REWARDS.md))

### How You Can Help

- Use inclusive language
- Amplify underrepresented voices
- Mentor newcomers
- Point out bias when you see it (constructively)
- Participate in our [Discussions](https://github.com/anchorpipe/anchorpipe/discussions)

## Our Standards

### Examples of Behavior that Contributes to a Positive Environment

- ✅ Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- ✅ Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

  - *Example: "I see what you're trying to solve. Have you considered using X approach because Y?"*

- ✅ Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

  - *Example: "You're right, my comment was dismissive. I apologize. Let me explain my concern more constructively."*

- ✅ Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- ✅ Showing empathy towards other community members
- ✅ **Welcoming and mentoring newcomers**

  - *Example: "Great first issue! Here's a guide that might help you get started."*

- ✅ **Assuming good intent and asking for clarification**

  - *Example: "I might be misunderstanding—could you help me understand your reasoning?"*

- ✅ **Celebrating others' contributions and achievements**

  - *Example: "This PR is excellent—really clean solution to a tricky problem!"*

- ✅ **Using inclusive language**

  - *Example: "folks" instead of "guys", "main" instead of "master"*

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- ❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

  - *Example: "This code is garbage" vs. "This approach has performance issues because..."*

- ❌ Public or private harassment
- ❌ Publishing others' private information without explicit permission (doxxing)
- ❌ **Sustained disruption of discussions or decision-making processes**

  - *Example: Repeatedly derailing technical discussions with off-topic arguments*

- ❌ **"Gatekeeping" or making others feel unwelcome**

  - *Example: "You shouldn't be contributing if you don't know X"*

- ❌ **Dismissing or belittling questions or contributions**

  - *Example: "This is obvious", "RTFM", "Just Google it"*

- ❌ **Taking credit for others' work or ideas without attribution**
- ❌ **Passive-aggressive behavior or backhanded compliments**

  - *Example: "Even someone new should know this", "Surprised this works"*

- ❌ Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

**Gray Areas?** When in doubt, ask yourself: *"Would I say/do this in a face-to-face conversation with a colleague I respect?"*

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, including:

### Official Project Spaces

- GitHub repositories (issues, PRs, discussions, comments)
- Official Discord/Slack channels (when established)
- Project mailing lists (when established)
- Documentation and wikis
- Official social media accounts
- Virtual or in-person events and meetups

### Representing the Project

This also applies when you're officially representing anchorpipe:

- Speaking at conferences on behalf of the project
- Posting via official social media accounts
- Using an official project email address
- Acting as an appointed representative at events

### Limited Applicability to Personal Spaces

**Personal social media and private communications** are generally outside our scope, EXCEPT when:

- You're explicitly representing anchorpipe (e.g., "as anchorpipe maintainer...")
- Behavior directly impacts community safety (e.g., threats against community members)
- There's evidence of coordinated harassment

**Questions about scope?** Contact conduct@anchorpipe.dev

## Resolving Issues

We encourage community members to resolve minor conflicts directly when possible. Here's how:

### Self-Resolution (Encouraged for Minor Issues)

**Before reporting**, consider if you can address it directly:

1. **Assume good intent** - Most conflicts stem from miscommunication
2. **Communicate privately** - Reach out via DM or email: "Hey, your comment felt dismissive. Can we talk?"
3. **Focus on impact** - "When you said X, I felt Y" rather than "You are/did Z"
4. **Seek to understand** - "Help me understand your perspective"

**Example:**

> "Hi @user, I noticed you said my PR was 'a mess'. I'm happy to improve it, but that phrasing felt harsh. Could you share specific concerns?"

### When to Escalate

**Report immediately if:**

- You feel unsafe or harassed
- The behavior is severe (threats, doxxing, discrimination)
- Direct resolution attempts failed
- You're uncomfortable addressing it directly
- The behavior is repeated after being addressed

**It's always okay to report.** You won't be blamed for escalating.

### Moderator Accountability

Community leaders are held to the highest standards:

- Violations by moderators are taken more seriously
- Moderators can be reported through the same channels
- All reports are investigated impartially

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

🚫 Level 4: Permanent Ban
```

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I'm not sure if something is a violation?</strong></summary>

**When in doubt, report it.** We'd rather review a non-issue than miss a serious problem. You won't be penalized for good-faith reports.

Self-reporting and genuine apologies are considered favorably.
