# Anchorpipe Playwright Integration Testing Rules

- Test service boundaries: API endpoints, database interactions, message queue flows.
- Use test databases with migrations; clean up after tests; use transactions where possible.
- Mock external services (GitHub API, S3); use test doubles for message queues.
- Test error scenarios: network failures, rate limits, invalid inputs.
- Verify idempotency, retries, and backpressure handling.
- Include correlation IDs in test assertions for traceability.
