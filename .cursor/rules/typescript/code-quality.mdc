# Anchorpipe TypeScript/JavaScript Code Quality

- Strong typing: Avoid `any`; use `unknown` for truly unknown types; prefer type inference where clear.
- Interface guidelines: Prefer interfaces for object shapes; use types for unions/intersections.
- Function length: Keep functions focused; extract complex logic; max ~50 lines per function.
- DRY principle: Extract repeated patterns; use shared utilities; avoid copy-paste code.
- Error handling: Use Result types or try/catch consistently; never swallow errors silently.
- Async/await: Prefer over raw promises; handle errors properly; avoid promise chains.
- Naming: camelCase for variables/functions; PascalCase for types/classes; UPPER_CASE for constants.
