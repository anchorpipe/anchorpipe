# Intellectual Property Assignment and Commercial Use Rights

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Purpose**: Clarify IP rights for contributions and commercial use

## Overview

This document clarifies intellectual property rights regarding contributions to anchorpipe. By contributing to anchorpipe, you grant certain rights that enable the project to maintain its open-source nature while allowing future commercialization.

## What You Grant When Contributing

When you contribute code, documentation, or other content to anchorpipe, you grant the following rights:

### 1. Open-Source License Rights

Your contributions are licensed under **AGPL v3** (the same license as the project). This means:

- ✅ Your code is open source and available to all
- ✅ Others can use, modify, and distribute your contributions
- ✅ You retain copyright ownership of your contributions

### 2. Commercial Use Rights

You grant anchorpipe (and future foundation/commercial entity) the right to:

- ✅ Use your contributions in commercial products and services
- ✅ Include your contributions in enterprise/paid versions
- ✅ License your contributions under different licenses for commercial use (dual licensing)
- ✅ Generate revenue from products that include your contributions

**Important**: You are **not** transferring ownership of your code. You are granting a license that allows commercial use.

### 3. Attribution Rights

anchorpipe commits to:

- ✅ Crediting you in release notes and documentation
- ✅ Maintaining contributor attribution in code
- ✅ Recognizing significant contributors publicly
- ✅ Including you in contributors list

### 4. No Warranty or Compensation

- ⚠️ Your contributions are provided "as-is" without warranty
- ⚠️ No immediate compensation for contributions (see CONTRIBUTOR_REWARDS.md for future programs)
- ⚠️ No guarantee that your contributions will be included

## How This Protects You

### What You Retain

- ✅ Copyright ownership of your code
- ✅ Right to use your own code in other projects
- ✅ Right to fork the project (AGPL v3 allows this)
- ✅ Right to modify and redistribute

### What You Can't Claim Later

- ❌ Compensation for past contributions when project commercializes
- ❌ Percentage of revenue from commercial products
- ❌ Veto power over commercial licensing decisions
- ❌ Exclusive rights to your contributions

## Why This Is Necessary

This IP assignment structure enables:

- **Open-Source Sustainability**: Maintains AGPL v3 open-source nature
- **Commercial Viability**: Allows future commercialization without legal disputes
- **Dual Licensing**: Enables enterprise licensing while keeping core open
- **Investor Confidence**: Clear IP ownership is required for funding

## Examples of Similar Projects

Many successful open-source projects use similar structures:

- **GitLab**: Dual license (MIT + commercial) with contributor agreements
- **MongoDB**: AGPL with commercial licensing, clear IP assignment
- **Elastic**: Contributor agreements that allow commercial use
- **Red Hat**: Clear contributor agreements enabling enterprise offerings

## For Significant Contributors

If you become a significant contributor and may receive:

- Equity or compensation
- Maintainer/committer status
- Commercial partnership opportunities

You may be asked to sign an additional Contributor License Agreement (CLA) that provides:

- More explicit IP assignment
- Equity consideration terms
- Revenue sharing (if applicable)
- Contributor agreement terms

**Note**: This is optional and only for significant contributors who will receive compensation.
