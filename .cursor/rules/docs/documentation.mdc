# Anchorpipe Documentation Rules

- How-to docs: Step-by-step instructions; include prerequisites; provide examples.
- Code examples: Working, tested examples; explain context; show error handling.
- API docs: OpenAPI/Swagger for REST; include request/response examples; document errors.
- README files: Purpose, setup, usage, contributing; keep updated with code changes.
- Inline comments: Explain why, not what; use JSDoc/Go doc for public APIs.
- Update docs when behavior changes; link to related docs; maintain doc versioning.
