# Gap Analysis: ST-211 - Implement Security Incident Response Plan

**Epic**: EPIC-00A (Security Foundation)  
**Story**: ST-211  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-11-09

## Overview

ST-211 implements a comprehensive Security Incident Response Plan (IRP) with defined procedures, team roles, communication protocols, and post-incident review processes.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **Incident Severity Classification**
   - ✅ Severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - ✅ Classification criteria defined
   - ✅ Response time SLAs per severity level

2. **Detection Mechanisms**
   - ✅ Automated alerts (monitoring, security scans)
   - ✅ Manual reports (user reports, security advisories)
   - ✅ Security reviews (code reviews, audits, penetration testing)

3. **Team Roles and Responsibilities**
   - ✅ Incident Commander (primary: Security Lead/CTO, backup: Engineering Lead)
   - ✅ Security Engineer (primary: Security Engineer/Senior Engineer, backup: Engineering Team)
   - ✅ Communication Lead (primary: Product Manager/CTO, backup: Engineering Lead)
   - ✅ On-Call Engineer (rotating on-call engineer)

4. **6-Phase Response Procedures**
   - ✅ Phase 1: Detection and Triage
   - ✅ Phase 2: Containment (immediate and short-term)
   - ✅ Phase 3: Investigation (evidence gathering, root cause analysis)
   - ✅ Phase 4: Eradication (threat removal, verification)
   - ✅ Phase 5: Recovery (service restoration, validation)
   - ✅ Phase 6: Post-Incident Review (lessons learned, action items)

5. **Communication Procedures**
   - ✅ Internal communication (incident channel, status updates)
   - ✅ External communication (user notification, regulatory notification, public disclosure)
   - ✅ Update cadence (hourly during active incidents, daily for ongoing)

6. **Escalation Procedures**
   - ✅ Escalation triggers defined
   - ✅ Escalation matrix documented
   - ✅ Reference to detailed escalation document

7. **Post-Incident Review**
   - ✅ Lessons learned process
   - ✅ Action item assignment
   - ✅ Documentation updates
   - ✅ Security control improvements

8. **Tabletop Exercise Procedures**
   - ✅ Exercise scenarios
   - ✅ Exercise frequency (quarterly)
   - ✅ Exercise documentation

9. **Security Contacts**
   - ✅ Security contacts document: `docs/SECURITY_CONTACTS.md`
   - ✅ Contact information and communication channels

10. **Escalation Procedures**
    - ✅ Escalation document: `docs/SECURITY_ESCALATION.md`
    - ✅ Detailed escalation matrix

11. **Documentation**
    - ✅ Incident Response Plan: `docs/reference/security/incident-response.md`
    - ✅ Security Contacts: `docs/SECURITY_CONTACTS.md`
    - ✅ Escalation Procedures: `docs/SECURITY_ESCALATION.md`
    - ✅ Main Security Policy: `SECURITY.md` (updated to reference IRP)

## Cross-Reference with Requirements

### PRD Requirements

- ✅ **Incident Response**: Comprehensive IRP with defined procedures
- ✅ **Team Roles**: Clear roles and responsibilities
- ✅ **Communication**: Internal and external communication procedures

### Architecture Requirements

- ✅ **6-Phase Process**: Detection, Containment, Investigation, Eradication, Recovery, Post-Incident Review
- ✅ **Escalation**: Defined escalation procedures
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation

### Quality Handbook Requirements

- ✅ **Security**: Comprehensive IRP for security incidents
- ✅ **Communication**: Clear communication procedures
- ✅ **Documentation**: Detailed procedures and contacts

## Identified Gaps

### None - Fully Implemented ✅

ST-211 is fully implemented according to the story requirements. All core features, procedures, and documentation are in place.

## Future Enhancements (Not Part of ST-211)

The following enhancements are documented but are **not** part of ST-211:

1. **Automated Incident Detection**: AI/ML-based anomaly detection (future enhancement)
2. **Incident Management Tool**: Integration with incident management platforms (future enhancement)
3. **Automated Response**: Automated containment actions (future enhancement)
4. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated compliance reports for incidents (future enhancement)

These are explicitly marked as future work and do not represent gaps in ST-211.

## Implementation Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies (Required Before ST-211)

- ✅ ST-206: Audit Logging (for incident investigation)
- ✅ ST-209: Security Scanning (for incident detection)

### Downstream Dependencies (ST-211 Enables)

- ✅ ST-211 provides incident response procedures for all future security incidents
- ✅ ST-212: Compliance Documentation (can reference IRP for GDPR/CCPA compliance)

## Testing Status

- ✅ Tabletop exercise procedures documented
- ✅ Exercise scenarios defined
- ✅ Manual testing: Procedures can be tested via tabletop exercises

## Documentation Status

- ✅ Incident Response Plan: `docs/reference/security/incident-response.md`
- ✅ Security Contacts: `docs/SECURITY_CONTACTS.md`
- ✅ Escalation Procedures: `docs/SECURITY_ESCALATION.md`
- ✅ Main Security Policy: `SECURITY.md` (updated)

## Conclusion

ST-211 is **fully implemented** with no identified gaps. All requirements from the story definition, PRD, and architecture documents have been met. The implementation includes comprehensive incident response procedures, team roles, communication protocols, and documentation.
