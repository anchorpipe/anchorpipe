# Anchorpipe Epic/Issue Template Rules

- Epic structure: Title, description, goals, acceptance criteria, dependencies, timeline.
- Issue templates: Use GitHub issue forms; require labels (type, gate, area, priority).
- Link to PRD/Architecture docs; reference related ADRs; include persona and JTBD.
- Acceptance criteria: Specific, testable, linked to quality budgets (a11y, perf, security).
- Dependencies: List blocking issues; identify gate requirements; track in project board.
- Engineering tickets: Include technical approach, risks, rollback plan, test strategy.
