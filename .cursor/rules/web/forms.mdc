# Anchorpipe Forms & Error States

- Validate with Zod; sanitize strings; reject unknown fields.
- Labels and helper text required; show inline errors and aria-live updates.
- Error copy must be actionable; provide recovery guidance where possible.
- Keyboard-first: focus management, Enter/ESC behavior, no key traps.
