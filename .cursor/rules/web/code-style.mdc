# Anchorpipe Code Style Consistency

- Formatting: Use Prettier; run on save; enforce in CI.
- Linting: ESLint with TypeScript plugin; fix auto-fixable issues.
- Imports: Absolute imports for packages; relative for local files; organize by type.
- File naming: kebab-case for files; PascalCase for components; camelCase for utilities.
- Component organization: One component per file; colocate related files (component + test + styles).
- Consistent patterns: Use established patterns from codebase; avoid introducing new styles without team discussion.
